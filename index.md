# **About me:**
Since childhood I have been helping people with computers': helped friends to optimize their computers, fixing little issues, also, installing The Sims 2 game for others.

In the last five years I was working with people, mostly with children, and I have finished my Bachelor's degree in Social Education. Nevertheless, I am seeking for new career opportunities and internships in the IT industry, especially into Software testing / Quality Assurance (QA). 

I would love to work in the IT industry because I see it as a very perspective and interesting sphere. I have skills that are needed: responsibility, attention to details, good time management and organization skills, communication skills, logical thinking, constant personal growth.
