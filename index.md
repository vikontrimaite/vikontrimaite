# **About me:**

Since childhood I were helping people "with computers": helped friends to clean their computers and make more space there, fixing little issues, also, installing The Sims 2 game for others and even making money this way.

In the last five years I was working with people, mostly with children, and I have finished my Bachelor's degree in Social Education. I have gained a lot of great experience working with different people, underastanding that everyone has a different approach to the world, so it is a must to give a unique help for each person. I believe that this principle also works in the IT wolrd where it is needed to have different solutions for different problems.

At the moment I am seeking for new career opportunities in IT industry and my career goal is to become Qaulity Assurance Specialist (QA) - Tester. After research I have decided that testing is the best choice for me because I have skills and characteristics that are needed in this field: 
- attention to details 
- love for anaylizing 
- love when things are in an order and explicit
- logical thinking
- responsible, finishing the task from the beggining to the end
- good time management
- organization skills
- communication skills
- happy to work solo or in a team 
- curious, learning and questioning all the time, constant personal growth
